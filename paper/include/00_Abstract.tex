\begin{abstract}
\biochem\ is framework for developing structure-based bioinformatics applications within the Julia ecosystem. Our library serves as a foundation providing rich functionality including file I/O, molecular modeling, molecular mechanics methods, and an accompanying visualization tool. \biochem\ is based on \ballFull (\ball), the largest open-source C++-framework of its kind. Our redesign emphasizes three design goals: ease of use, rapid application development (RAD), and functionality. Transitioning from C++ to Julia significantly simplified the realization of our design.
