BiochemicalAlgorithms.jl is a redesign of the popular [Biochemical Algorithms Library (BALL)](https://github.com/BALL-Project/ball), the largest open source C++-framework of its kind. We focused on three main design goals: efficiency, ease of use and rapid application development (RAD). Our library provides functionality for file I/O, molecular modelling, molecular mechanics methods, and molecular visualization, and hence can serve as a foundation for developing applications within the Julia ecosystem.

# Installation
BiochemicalAlgorithms is not yet registered as a Julia Language package. To install BiochemicalAlgorithms open a Julia REPL, switch to the package mode by pressing `]` and type


```{julia}
pkg> add https://github.com/hildebrandtlab/BiochemicalAlgorithms.jl.git
``` 

# Usage

Here is a simple impression of what you can do with BiochemicalAlgorithms.jl. 
Central to every application is a `System`, which is filled with structures by reading in atom coordinates from pdb or pubchem json files. The system is preprocessed by the `FragementDB` performing three steps: name normalization, reconstruction of missing atoms and the construction of atomic bonds. The energy of the structure is evaluated using Amber forcefield.  With the help of [BiochemicalVisualization.jl](https://github.com/hildebrandtlab/BiochemicalVisualization.jl) the structure can be visualized as a ball_and_stick model.

```{julia}
using BiochemicalAlgorithms
using BiochemicalVisualization

# Read PDB file from the BiochemicalAlgorithms.jl repository
pdb_sys = load_pdb(ball_data_path("../test/data/AlaAla.pdb"))

println("Number of atoms: ", natoms(sys))
println("Number of bonds: ", nbonds(sys))

# Prepare Molecule
fdb = FragmentDB()
normalize_names!(sys, fdb)
reconstruct_fragments!(sys, fdb)
build_bonds!(sys, fdb)
println("Number of bonds: ", nbonds(sys))

# Create Amber ForceField and compute the energy of the system
amber = AmberForceField(sys)
compute_energy(amber)
a_ff.energy["Bond Stretches"] 

ball_and_stick(sys)
```
